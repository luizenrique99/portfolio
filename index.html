                     <p class="subtitle">I'm <b class="my_name">Luiz Camargo</b>, a Brazilian Software Engineer passionate for solving problems and create new things.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">Mayara's husband, son of Alessandro and Paula and grandson of Mrs. Geni, I was born in the state of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. The year was 1999, almost at the turn of the millennium.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">In my spare time, I like to watch series, workout, order food in apps, chat and also develop some apps.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">My greatest quality in my opinion is my ability to not hold grudges. I discovered this yesterday. I think it's a good quality, I prefer not to feed on bad thoughts and things.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">My first contact with the programming world was in mid-2014, when I was just 15 years old. For some reason I discovered an MIT website called App inventor, and there I saw how it worked and learned how to use the tool by creating Android apps without even knowing anything about programming. I just used the tool's blocks and forum tips. As a result, I took a lot of unconscious baggage for logic and a flame inside me to build applications, and, at the time, I didn't even know what programming actually was. But I knew that I liked what happened.</p>
                     <p class="subtitle">If you've come this far, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this short summary, it was nice talking to you. Hope to meet you soon.</p>

                        At Aka Tecnologia, a software factory I was assigned to joining the Safetychem system team of a client named Intertox.
                        Safetychem is a web application that many companies use to optimize their process of issuing and managing chemical safety documents. In compliance with current Brazilian and international standards and legislation, I worked on this system during these two years.

                        Within the project I worked from bug fixes to implementations of new modules according to the RoadMap.

                        I joined DP World on a 1 month summer internship program. At the end of this 1 month internship I had to present a project. The directors liked my project so much that I was hired for 2 years to be part of the team as an intern.

                        My day-to-day consisted of meeting internally the demands of the port's employees, as the clients of the systems opened cases. Also there was an external system for scheduling the container part and an internal system used by employees at work.

Sociable and didactic, he was always concerned that he understood all the development processes, without failing to deliver the necessary results to the team, which shows how responsible and competent he is. Communicative and focused, when facing challenges he was not ashamed to ask others, working in sync with the team and not being afraid to face challenges. At the end of the contract, we developed a project together in which I am proud to have gone straight to production. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him and to still keep in touch, because in addition to being a great professional, he is a great person, good and reliable.</p>
